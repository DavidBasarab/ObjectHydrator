ObjectHydrator
==============

This project allows you to pass custom POCO's to it, and have it return an instance of the class populated with randomly generated data. This random data can be overridden by convention.

Current version 0.6.1

Version 0.6.1 is a breaking change as FromListGenerator's name has been changed to FromListGetSingleGenerator

You can install with NuGet: Install-Package objecthydrator

This version is for Visual Studio 2010 .Net 4

I'll switch to a newer version and use 2013 if there is interest.
